# TFTTracker
Tracks a specified players rank for TFT (will be extended to League and Apex? in the future)
WIP will update readme once basic features are added.
This bot is one of the first projects I've worked on so much of the initial source code to get the discord bot up and running is borrowed from sabe.io.
(https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-build-discord-bot-typescript).

# DEPENDENCIES: npm - tokenbucket, discordjs, ts-node, @types/node, tslib
